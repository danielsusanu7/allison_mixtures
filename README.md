# allison_mixtures

Hi there,

This is a repository containing the work I've done for my dissertation paper.

I've found about this 'allison mixtures' concept through my thesis advisor and, I must admit, I had some fun while exploring it. Apparently, based on 2 random sequences of numbers, un-correlated, that don't give you any useful information on their own, you can create a 3rd sequence through a process called **allison mixture** which will have an auto-correlation and auto-covariance different than 0! Pretty cool, right?

Well, with this 3rd series you can now get some insights on those 2 initial ones and maybe add a new feature to your machine learning dataset, improve the security of your network, something similar could be used to study the movement of stock prices and the phenomenon of volatility pumping etc.

I've attached the thesis as well, but I have just the Romanian version of it :(. Nonetheless, I've also left you a paper that guided me through the process and the code should be self-explanatory.

Just to give you a brief description, I took concepts from statistics, probability, math, games theory, economics and combined them into this wonderful theoretical paper!

Soo, have fun exploring the code & the thesis (even though you might not understand a word, it should have some useful tables and plots there) and let me know if you got any questions or want to find out more. See ya!
